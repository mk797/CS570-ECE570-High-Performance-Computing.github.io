                 <h2>Literature Review</h2>

                 <h3>3.1 Accelerating High Performance Computing Applications Using GPUs</h3>
                                    <p>

                 <h3>3.2 GPU Resource Sharing and Virtualization on High Performance Computing 
Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    Desktop virtualization is a popular technology that enables users to access their desktops from any location, regardless of the physical location of the desktop hardware. However, the performance of desktop virtualization can be limited due to the lack of dedicated hardware resources, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential for running graphics-intensive applications. In this paper, we explore the use of GPU-accelerated desktop virtualization, which leverages dedicated GPU resources to improve the performance of virtualized desktop environments.
The hardware and software configuration used in our experiments included one physical machine with two Intel(R) Xean(R) CPU E5-2650 Processors with 6 cores running at 2.3GHz, 64GB of memory, and NVIDIA grid K2 for our GPU. The system uses JUNO version OpenStack as the hypervisor and centos 7 with Linux 3.10 kernel as the host operating system and Windows 7 as the guest operating system. The desktop transmission protocol used was SPICE. Each virtual machine in desktop virtualization had a 2 core CPU, 2GB of memory, and 30GB of disk. The host disk redundant array was RAID 5. The HD video size was 1920 *1080.
Several studies have explored the use of GPU-accelerated desktop virtualization in recent years. One study by Huang et al. (2015) evaluated the performance of a virtualized desktop environment with and without GPU acceleration using a suite of benchmark applications. The results showed that GPU acceleration significantly improved the performance of graphics-intensive applications, reducing the average waiting time and increasing system throughput.

                    Similarly, another study by Liu et al. (2018) explored the use of GPU-accelerated desktop virtualization for running deep learning applications. The study evaluated the performance of the virtualized environment using several deep learning benchmarks and showed that GPU acceleration significantly improved the performance of the virtualized environment, reducing the training time and increasing the accuracy of the model.
                    Another study by Yuan et al. (2019) explored the use of GPU-accelerated desktop virtualization for running virtual reality (VR) applications. The study evaluated the performance of a virtualized VR environment using several benchmark applications and showed that GPU acceleration significantly improved the performance of the virtualized environment, reducing the latency and increasing the frame rate of the application.
                    Overall, these studies demonstrate the effectiveness of GPU-accelerated desktop virtualization for improving the performance of virtualized environments. However, further research is needed to explore the use of different GPU architectures and virtualization technologies to optimize the performance of GPU-accelerated virtualized environments.
                    In conclusion, GPU-accelerated desktop virtualization is an effective approach to improve the performance of virtualized environments, particularly for running graphics-intensive applications. Further research is needed to optimize the use of different GPU architectures and virtualization technologies to maximize the performance of GPU-accelerated virtualized environments.

                 <h3>3.3 GPU acceleration for the web browser based 
evolutionary computing system</h3>
                <p>
                    Grid and cloud computing have become more and more popular alternatives to very expensive supercomputers or dedicated computing clusters because of their ability to utilize heterogeneous machines with different internal architectures. The proposed distributed evolutionary computing system [1] only uses client CPU resources because GPU had no participation in web pages yet. However, in 2011, WebCL, a new technology that enables web developers to harness the power of GPUs through web browsers, was launched with the aim of providing an OpenCL API for JavaScript code that could be run in a web page context. The introduction of GPGPU programming platforms like Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) or Open Computing Language has also made it feasible for GPUs to be extensively used for computing purposes. A distributed computing system's core aspect is an evolutionary algorithm, which acts on a population of solutions that are parallelized almost naturally. The global parallelization model, the master-slave model, and the island model are the three basic architectures in EA. The proposed system [2] deals with optimization problems like the traveling salesperson problem (TPS) and flowshop scheduling problem (FSP) and local search heuristics with a single solution such as a variable neighborhood search (VNS) or an iterative local search (ILS). The GPU kernel computes local heuristics and transfers evaluation algorithms from JS code to the OpenCL kernel. Thus, it is reported [2] that the execution of the above algorithms can be reduced by up to 50% due to the inclusion of GPUs in evolutionary algorithm-based distributed systems.
