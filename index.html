            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The rapid evolution of technology has witnessed remarkable developments in processing power,
                significantly shaping various industries and applications. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which have
                transformed from simple video display controllers to powerful parallel processing powerhouses, are at
                the forefront of this revolution. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the history and
                evolution of GPUs, their architectural components, and their diverse applications. The article discusses
                the intricacies of GPU architectures like Nvidia's GTX 980 and the advancements offered by A100 and H100
                GPU accelerators, which cater to artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and data
                analytics. Furthermore, we explore the impact of GPU acceleration on distributed computing systems like
                Apache Spark, highlighting the performance boost they offer in machine learning tasks. </p>
            <h3>1.1 GPU Accelerators </h3>
            <p>A GPU, or graphics processing unit, is a specialized processor composed of numerous cores tailored to
                efficiently process large batches of data by performing identical operations repeatedly at high speeds.
                By leveraging parallel processing, these cores work in tandem to manage thousands of threads
                simultaneously. GPUs are a critical component of a wide range of computing devices, from personal
                computers to smartphones. Initially, GPUs were developed to expedite the rendering of 3D graphics. As
                their flexibility and programmability improved over time, their applications broadened to include
                accelerated video rendering, machine learning, financial simulations and risk modeling, as well as
                scientific computations. </p>
            <p>GPU acceleration refers to the technique of utilizing a GPU to execute computing tasks that are
                conventionally managed by a CPU. This involves transferring some processing responsibilities from the
                CPU to the GPU, which excels in parallel processing and can simultaneously handle multiple tasks. By
                harnessing the power of GPUs, users can benefit from faster processing speeds, enhanced efficiency, and
                cost-effective solutions.</p>
            <p>The two primary categories of GPU acceleration are Compute acceleration, that is employed for
                general-purpose computing tasks, such as scientific computations, data analysis, and machine learning
                and Graphics acceleration that is utilized for activities like gaming and video rendering.</p>
            <h3>1.2 Types of GPU Accelerators </h3>
            <h4>i. IGPU</h4>
            <img src="/img/1.png" alt="IGPU"
                style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: auto;">
            <p>An integrated GPU, or iGPU, is a graphics processing unit that is combined with the CPU on a single chip.
                This type of GPU is built into the motherboard and is commonly found in ultra-thin devices such as
                laptops and IntelÂ® NUCs. The iGPU offers several advantages, including lower power consumption, which
                leads to reduced heat generation and potentially longer battery life. Additionally, devices with
                integrated graphics tend to be more affordable. While iGPUs can handle light gaming and editing tasks,
                their processing power is generally more limited compared to dedicated GPUs. Intel is among the
                companies that manufacture CPUs with integrated graphics. The performance of iGPUs is largely dependent
                on the capabilities of the other components within the system.</p>
            <h4>ii. DGPU</h4>
            <img src="/img/2.png" alt="IGPU"
                style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: auto;">
            <p>Discrete graphics refers to a GPU that is separate from the processor. As an independent component,
                discrete graphics offer several advantages, including their own dedicated VRAM (video RAM or video
                random access memory). However, they also consume more power and generate substantial heat. Discrete
                graphics typically provide higher performance than integrated graphics and are predominantly found in
                desktop PCs, although some laptops and small form factor PCs may also feature discrete graphics cards.
                These GPUs connect to the motherboard and are larger and more power-hungry than their integrated
                counterparts. Discrete graphics are ideal for running resource-intensive graphics, effects, and videos,
                as well as for executing high-performance tasks. NVIDIA and AMD are the leading manufacturers in the
                discrete GPU market. </p>
            <h3>1.3 History and Evolution of GPU</h3>
            <p>The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has undergone a remarkable transformation over the past decades,
                impacting computer graphics, parallel computing, gaming experiences, and artificial intelligence
                applications. This article focuses the history and evolution of the GPU, from its humble beginnings as
                simple video display controllers to today's sophisticated parallel processing powerhouses.
                The journey of the GPU began with the development of basic video display controllers in the 1970s and
                1980s, which primarily focused on generating video signals. It wasn't until 1994 when Sony first used
                the term "Graphics Processing Unit" (GPU) with the release of their PlayStation console (Smith, 2015).
                In 1999, NVIDIA launched the GeForce 256, the first GPU to combine transformation and lighting
                calculations (T&L) into a single chip, leading to more intricate and real-time graphics rendering
                (NVIDIA, n.d.).
                Throughout the early 2000s, GPU technology advanced rapidly, with NVIDIA and ATI (now part of AMD)
                competing to create increasingly powerful and efficient GPU architectures. By 2002, the concept of
                General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) emerged, broadening the scope of GPUs
                beyond graphics-related tasks. This period of growth saw NVIDIA ship 500 million GPUs by 2006 (Hruska,
                2006). That same year, NVIDIA introduced the G80 architecture, which featured unified shaders and paved
                the way for general-purpose GPU computing. This shift transformed GPUs from specialized graphics
                processors into versatile parallel computing devices. The move towards general-purpose GPU computing
                unlocked new applications beyond graphics processing. NVIDIA unveiled CUDA (Compute Unified Device
                Architecture) in 2006, a parallel computing platform that enabled developers to use GPUs for various
                computing tasks (NVIDIA, 2006). This innovation allowed GPUs to be applied in areas such as artificial
                intelligence and high-performance computing (Owens et al., 2008).
                OpenCL (Open Computing Language), launched in 2009, is an open standard for parallel programming of
                heterogeneous systems (Khronos Group, 2009). It allows developers to leverage the computing power of
                different hardware platforms, such as CPUs, GPUs, Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), and
                Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), using a single codebase. OpenCL's flexibility makes it possible
                for developers to optimize code for specific hardware architectures and create performance-portable
                applications.
            </p>
            <p>Introduced in 2011, OpenACC is a high-level, directive-based programming model designed to simplify
                parallel application development on heterogeneous systems (OpenACC, 2011). OpenACC enables developers to
                offload compute-intensive tasks to accelerators like GPUs without extensive code modifications,
                improving productivity and allowing them to focus on algorithms and overall application performance.
                OpenACC is especially valuable for scientists and engineers who may not be experts in parallel
                programming, as it abstracts the complexities of hardware-specific optimization and parallelization.
                By 2020, many of the world's top supercomputers integrated GPU accelerators to enhance their
                computational abilities. As highlighted by the June 2020 TOP500 list, roughly 25% of these
                high-performance systems used GPUs for faster processing and improved energy efficiency (TOP500, 2020).
                The inclusion of GPUs in supercomputers facilitated efficient handling of complex simulations, data
                analysis, and artificial intelligence tasks.
                The growing use of GPU accelerators in supercomputers demonstrates the trend towards heterogeneous
                computing architectures, which blend different processor types for optimal performance and energy
                efficiency (Mittal & Vetter, 2015). Due to their parallel processing capabilities, GPUs can execute
                multiple threads simultaneously, making them ideal for accelerating a diverse range of applications in
                science, engineering, and machine learning.
            </p>
            <h3>1.4 CPU vs GPU </h3>
            <h4>i. Architectural differences between CPUs and GPUs </h4>
            <p>A primary distinction between CPUs and GPUs stems from their architectural design. The CPU consists of a
                limited number of cores equipped with substantial cache memory, allowing it to manage a few software
                threads concurrently. These CPU cores are optimized for handling intricate operations, including data
                transfer between local registers, various cache levels (L1, L2, and L3), RAM, and hard disk storage,
                while efficiently switching between application tasks. CPUs are typically designed for sequential
                processing, excelling in a broad array of tasks and emphasizing singlethreaded performance. </p>
            <img src="/img/3.png" alt="IGPU"
                style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: auto;">
            <p>Conversely, a GPU boasts a significantly larger number of cores than a CPU, enabling it to process
                thousands of threads simultaneously. The multitude of cores in a GPU allows it to fetch data from
                memory, conduct parallel computations, and return the data for further use. GPUs are engineered for
                parallel processing and focus on executing multiple threads concurrently. This design makes them
                well-suited for handling data-intensive tasks such as rendering graphics and conducting complex
                mathematical operations. </p>
            <h4>ii. Performance comparison in general-purpose computing </h4>
            <p>The growing interest in using GPUs for general-purpose computing (GPGPU) has led to numerous studies
                comparing their performance with that of traditional CPUs. GPUs can outperform CPUs in various
                applications, such as machine learning, simulations, and data analysis, due to their ability to process
                multiple threads simultaneously. However, it is essential to note that GPUs may not always be the
                optimal choice for all applications, as some tasks may not be well-suited for parallel execution or may
                require specific instruction sets that are better supported by CPUs. The performance of GPUs is
                calculated in terms of FLOPS (Floating Point Operations
                Per Second).
                According to study by Yifan Sun, Nicolas Bohm Agostini, Shi Dong, and David Kaeli, the performance of
                GPUs is exponentially increasing and the FLOPS per watt doubles around every three to four years.
            </p>
            <img src="/img/4.png" alt="IGPU"
                style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: auto;">
            <h4>iii. Energy efficiency considerations </h4>
            <p>CPUs generally consume more power to achieve their goals, especially when handling diverse tasks.
                However, for parallelizable tasks, CPUs may not be the most energy-efficient choice due to their limited
                number of cores and sequential processing approach. On the other hand, GPUs can execute these tasks with
                lower energy consumption per operation than CPUs, thanks to their architecture, which is specifically
                designed for the concurrent execution of thousands of threads. Nevertheless, when dealing with workloads
                that are not parallelizable, GPUs may use more energy without delivering a corresponding increase in
                performance.

                A study by Yifan Sun, Nicolas Bohm Agostini, Shi Dong, and David Kaeli demonstrated that GPUs often
                provide better performance-per-watt ratios compared to CPUs for various parallel computing tasks, making
                them a more energy-efficient option in such situations. However, the energy efficiency of GPUs can be
                affected by factors including programming models, memory access patterns, and the degree of parallelism
                present in the application.

            <h2>GPU ARCHITECTURE </h2>
            <img src="/img/5.png" alt="IGPU"
                style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: auto;">
            <p>The architecture of a GPU includes various components designed to enable efficient processing of
                computationally intensive tasks such as graphics rendering and scientific simulations. The GPU's
                processing power is harnessed through the use of multiple cores, which can each execute a
                single-instruction multiple-thread (SIMT) program. These cores are capable of running thousands of
                threads simultaneously and can communicate with each other through scratchpad memory and barrier
                operations. Additionally, each core has its own first-level instruction and data caches, which serve to
                reduce memory system traffic. The large number of threads running on each core helps to compensate for
                the latency involved in accessing memory when data is not found in the first-level caches. (Aamodt el
                at. 2018). </p>
            <h4><b>Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) </b></h4>
            <p></p>

            <h4><b>Memory </b></h4>
            <p>GPUs typically have their own dedicated memory (VRAM) that is used to store data and instructions for
                processing. The amount of memory can vary depending on the GPU model. </p>
            <h4><b>Memory Controller </b></h4>
            <p>The memory controller is responsible for managing the flow of data between the GPU's memory and the
                processing units. </p>
            <h4><b>Texture Mapping Units (TMUs)</b></h4>
            <p>TMUs are responsible for mapping textures onto 3D objects in a scene. </p>
            <h4><b>Raster Operations Pipeline (ROP)</b></h4>
            <p>The ROP is responsible for finalizing the rendering process by processing pixel data and generating
                output images. </p>
            <h4><b>Compute Capability </b></h4>
            <p>Modern GPUs are capable of performing more than just graphics rendering and are often used for
                general-purpose computing tasks such as machine learning and scientific simulations. The computing
                capability of a GPU refers to its ability to perform these types of calculations.</p>
            <h4><b>Bus Interface </b></h4>
            <p>The bus interface is responsible for communicating with the CPU and other components in the system,
                allowing data to be transferred to and from the GPU.</p>

            <h4>2.1 SIMT CORE </h4>
            <img src="/img/6.png" alt="IGPU"
                style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: auto;">
            <p>In order to optimize performance, GPUs organize threads into groups known as warps or wave fronts by
                NVIDIA and AMD, respectively. These warps represent the unit of scheduling, with the hardware selecting
                a warp for scheduling during each cycle. Using the one-loop approximation, the program counter of the
                selected warp is used to access instruction memory and find the next instruction to execute. Once the
                instruction is fetched, it is decoded and source operand registers are fetched from the register file.
                The SIMT execution mask values are determined in parallel with fetching source operands from the
                register file. Execution proceeds in a single-instruction, multiple-data manner with each thread
                executing on the functional unit associated with a lane provided the SIMT execution mask is set. GPUs
                may contain several function units, each supporting only a subset of instructions. To achieve higher
                performance per unit area, some GPUs execute a single warp or wave front over several clock cycles by
                clocking the function units at a higher frequency. When scheduling a large number of warps, it can be
                difficult to keep track of each state and requires a significant number of registers. To address this
                issue, the number of warps can be decreased, and the number of instructions scheduled from the same warp
                can be increased. A scoreboard is used to keep track of dependencies, which helps remove any potential
                conflicts that may arise from reading operands from the same register bank. To avoid stalls and optimize
                throughput, instructions may be replayed and kept in the instruction buffer until at least some part of
                the instruction is completed. Read barriers are also utilized to prevent hazards, and overlap between
                register banks can be used to avoid conflicts when reading operands from the same bank (Aamodt el at.
                2018). </p>

            <h4>2.2 Architecture of Nvidia GeForce GTX 980 </h4>
            <p></p>
            <img src="/img/7.png" alt="IGPU"
                style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: auto;">
            <p>The GTX 980 is based on Nvidia's Maxwell architecture, which is designed to be powerefficient while still
                delivering high performance. It has 2048 CUDA cores, which are used for the parallel processing of
                graphics and other computations. In total it has 4 memory controllers each attached to a graphic
                processing cluster. Each cluster has 4 SMMs, in total it has 16 SMSs. In SMMs, each SMM has its own
                I-buffer and warp scheduler, register file, and dispatch units. One SMM consists of 128 cores which are
                divided into 4 blocks. Along with this, it has a Load/Store unit and SFUs. The GTX 980 has a base clock
                speed of 1126 MHz, which can be boosted to 1216 MHz under load. It also has 4 GB of GDDR5 memory with a
                256-bit memory interface, providing a maximum bandwidth of 224 GB/s. </p>
            <p>One of the key features of the Maxwell architecture is the use of dynamic parallelism, which allows the
                GPU to create and launch new threads on the fly, without having to return to the CPU. This allows for
                more efficient processing of complex tasks, such as physics simulations or artificial intelligence
                algorithms.
                The GTX 980 also includes Nvidia's VXGI (Voxel Global Illumination) technology, which enables real-time
                global illumination and dynamic reflections in games. It also supports Nvidia's G-Sync technology, which
                synchronizes the refresh rate of the monitor with the output of the GPU, eliminating screen tearing and
                reducing input lag. In terms of power consumption, the GTX 980 has a TDP (thermal design power) of 165
                watts, which is relatively low compared to previous high-end graphics cards. This is partly due to the
                use of Nvidia's MFAA (Multi-Frame AntiAliasing) technology, which provides improved image quality with
                less processing power than traditional anti-aliasing techniques (NVIDIA., 2014).

            <h2>CASE STUDY </h2>
            <h4>Apache spark 3.0 </h4>
            <p>Apache Spark is an open-source distributed computing system that enables the processing of large-scale
                data sets. With the introduction of Spark 3.0, the system now supports GPU acceleration, which
                significantly boosts the performance of machine learning tasks. Spark's new GPU support leverages the
                power of GPUs to speed up the training and inference of machine learning models. GPUs excel at
                performing matrix operations, which are critical for many machine-learning algorithms. </p>

            <img src="/img/13.png" alt="IGPU"
                style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: auto;">

            <p>To provide GPU support, Spark 3.0 includes the CUDA-based Spark Accelerator for Apache Arrow or cuDF.
                cuDF is a GPU DataFrame library that provides a Pandas-like API for working with data on the GPU. It
                enables data scientists and engineers to take advantage of the parallel processing capabilities of the
                GPU to speed up data manipulation and preprocessing tasks, such as joining, filtering, and aggregating.
                In addition to cuDF, Spark 3.0 also includes GPUaccelerated MLlib algorithms for common machine learning
                tasks, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and k-means clustering.
                A typical data science problem follows these steps in its data pipeline path. Collecting the data,
                extracting the data, and loading the data into the database. Storing the data in the structured data
                store. Then it follows these steps in data training, data preparation, model training, and evaluating
                the model and inference from the data. Between each step, there is a time delay because this pipeline is
                divided into multiple stages and it has very high latency due to stalls between each step.
            </p>
            <p>To eliminate these stalls, in apache spark 3.0, all the steps in the data pipeline are integrated into a
                single data pipeline. From collecting data to deploying data can be automated in a single pipeline which
                reduces latencies.
                The main advantage of apache spark 3.0 is it has added support for GPU acceleration through RAPIDS, a
                bundle of open-source software libraries developed by NVIDIA to enable GPU acceleration for data
                processing and machine learning workloads. With RAPIDS, Spark can take advantage of GPUs to accelerate
                data processing and machine learning tasks. This is achieved by offloading compute-intensive tasks to
                the GPU, which can perform computations in parallel, leading to significant performance gains.
            </p>

            <img src="/img/14.png" alt="IGPU"
                style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: auto;">

            <p>RAPIDS integrate with Spark through the use of Spark plugins, which enable users to take advantage of GPU
                acceleration without modifying their Spark code. With the RAPIDS plugin, Spark can leverage the power of
                GPUs to accelerate data processing and machine learning workloads, including ETL, SQL queries, and
                machine learning algorithms. One of the key benefits of using RAPIDS with Spark is the ability to
                process large volumes of data much faster than traditional CPU-based systems. This is particularly
                important for use cases that require processing large amounts of data in near real-time, such as fraud
                detection, recommendation engines, and financial analytics.
                Through rapids, it is possible to achieve 50 to 100 times faster speed when compared to a data pipeline
                that involves HDFS read and disk operations and with a normal spark in-memory data pipeline it is
                possible to achieve 25 to 100 times faster speed for the same pipeline (NVIDIA., 2023).
